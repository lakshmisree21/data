 INGREDIENTS (measuring cup used, 1 cup = 250 ml)  1 cup regular rice (sona masuri or parimal rice or surti kolam) 1.5 to 2 cups water or add as required salt as required oil for making dosas   
 INSTRUCTIONS  soak 1 cup rice in enough water for 4 to 5 hours or overnight drain the soaked rice and add them in a wet grinder jar. just add water enough for grinding the rice. if you add all the water then you won't be able to grind the rice well. grind to a smooth batter and then take it in another bowl or pan. add more water to get a thin flowing watery consistency. i added 2 cups of water for 1 cup of rice. the addition of water depends on the quality and kind of rice. so add water as required. then add salt as required and stir well. in a cast iron pan or a non stick pan. drizzle Â½ tsp of oil. just spread the oil all over with a spoon or small piece of cotton kitchen napkin. stir the batter and take a ladle full of batter. then pour the batter moving outwards to inside like the way we do for rava dosa. fill in the large gaps too with some of the batter. cover with a lid and cook the neer dosa till done. don't brown it or flip it. make a triangular fold on the tawa itself. then remove the dosa and place it in a plate. make neer dosas this way and place them separately without them touching each other in a plate. serve neer dosa hot or warm with coconut chutney, veg sagu, veg korma.
